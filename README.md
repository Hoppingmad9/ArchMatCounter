### Edit Mode

Enabling this will enable a couple editable options.

First, the "Hide" column will become visible.  This will allow the user to hide specific columns, regardless of Qty.

Next, the Qty and Goal boxes for each material can be edited.  Useful for tracking your current material count, or setting goals for certain materials.

When setting a goal, once the Qty amount is greater than, or equal to the goal, the material row will highlight in green.
